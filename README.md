# OOPLAI

This repository contains code form the book [OOPLAI](https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~etanter/ooplai/index.html).

Summary of oop features from function to class, mixins and traits in this book.

1. stateful closure function
1. object pattern
1. factory pattern
1. object and factory with self reference
1. prototyped based oop on top of object object & factory pattern
1. class pattern without inheritance
    1. extract shared methods of multiple objects as class
    1. class provides open recursion
    1. anonymous local class
1. class with inheritance
1. mixin and traits provide a flexible composition of class

[Chapter 3 Extensibility](https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~etanter/ooplai/adt-oo.html#%28part._.The_.Extensibility_.Problem%29) in my opinion, is the highlight of this book, which discusses two-dimension extensibility problem about structure and operations. ADT and OOP each succeeds at handling one dimension of the two-dimension extensibility problem and fails at the other.
